            "task_description": "Overview\nThis team-based assignment challenges you to explore less conventional forms of innovation—not products or services—and examine their broader impacts. Your team will create a photo essay that visually and analytically presents an innovation, identifying its enablers, beneficiaries, and potential disruptions. The aim is to provoke deeper thinking about innovation’s complexity, its ripple effects across industries, and its influence on society. Consider looking for examples close to home—perhaps from your own professional backgrounds or industries your team is familiar with.\nAssignment Structure\nPart 1: Identifying and Showcasing an Innovation\nChoose an innovation that is not a product or service but represents a new way of doing things (e.g. innovations in policy, infrastructure, societal systems, cultural practices, or production processes). Take or source a photo that visually represents the innovation.\nIn your presentation, describe:\nWhat the innovation is.\nWhat makes it innovative.\nWhy it is significant, focusing on its business and economic implications rather than purely technological aspects.\nPart 2: Exploring Its Enablers\nIdentify 3-5 enablers that made this innovation possible (e.g. supporting infrastructure, economic conditions, cultural factors, policy changes, or enabling technologies). Use photos to illustrate these enablers.\nDiscuss the role of each enabler in supporting the innovation, including any advantages or disadvantages they bring.\nPart 3: Analysing the Beneficiaries\nShow 2-4 images depicting those who benefit from this innovation (e.g. individuals, organisations, industries, or communities). Explain how the innovation creates value by:\nSolving problems ('pain relievers').\nCreating new opportunities ('gain creators').\nConsidering any negative externalities (e.g. unintended consequences, ethical considerations).\nPart 4: Evaluating Potential Disruptions\nUse 2-4 images to show areas of the economy, industries, or organisations that are disrupted or threatened by this innovation. Analyse the impact of these disruptions, applying relevant theories of innovation and competitive dynamics.\nDiscuss the long-term implications for affected sectors.\nPresentation Requirements\nYour team will present the photo essay in class, with each team member contributing to either the content creation or delivery.\nNot all members need to present, but all must contribute and be present for Q&A.\nYour slides must be uploaded to Blackboard before class begins.\nTip: Engage your audience! Use clear visuals, storytelling techniques, and compelling analysis to make your presentation impactful.\nPhoto Guidelines\nWherever possible, take original photos to strengthen your analysis.\nIf original photos are not feasible, you may use online images, ensuring they are credited appropriately.\nThe quality of the photos is less important than their clarity and relevance to your argument.\nPeer Review Requirement\nEach student must submit an individual peer evaluation via Blackboard.\nFailure to submit a peer review will result in a zero score for both the team presentation and the Innovation Strategy Report.\nWhy Peer Review? This ensures fair contribution across team members and encourages collaborative leadership, accountability, and reflection.\nMarking Rubric is available on Blackboard\nAI Statement\nThis assignment is designed to be challenging, authentic, and complex, requiring critical engagement beyond AI-generated content.\nYou may use AI or MT tools to assist with organising ideas, structuring analysis, or enhancing presentation design.\nHowever, all insights and critical thinking must be your own—you must demonstrate independent comprehension in your work.\nFailure to reference AI use may constitute academic misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct.\nFinal Reminders\nChoose a unique, thought-provoking innovation—challenge conventional ideas.\nUse clear visuals and strong analysis to tell a compelling story.\nCollaborate effectively—all team members must contribute meaningfully.\nSubmit slides on Blackboard before class—no late submissions accepted.\nBe ready for Q&A—demonstrate your deep understanding of the innovation.\nTip: Need inspiration?

The objective is to critically analyse the challenges and insights gained from managing innovation transitions and relate them to relevant academic literature and workplace practice.\nThe simulation models the transition from an existing business to a new, innovative model. While this example focuses on a product, its principles apply equally to any business navigating Horizon 2 innovations. Your essay must demonstrate analytical depth, drawing connections between simulation experience, innovation themes, and real-world business applications.\nTask Description\nYour reflective essay should address the following key areas:\nSimulation Experience: Describe your experience with the simulation. What challenges did you encounter? What decisions were particularly difficult, and why?\nInnovation Themes: How did the simulation reflect key innovation concepts discussed in class? Consider:\nThe Christensen framework on disruptive innovation.\nThe challenges of integrating a Horizon 2 innovation into Horizon 1 (Refer to Moore, Geoffrey A. \"To Succeed in the Long-Term, Focus on the Middle-Term,” Harvard Business Review, 2006).\nLessons about managing disruptive innovation.\nWorkplace Reflection: Based on your simulation insights, how can the lessons be applied to managing innovation and technological change in your current or previous workplace?\nThe essay must follow proper academic formatting and use APA referencing style. A descriptive summary will not be sufficient—you will be assessed on your ability to analyse, synthesise, and evaluate experiences against the simulation and relevant literature.\nSimulation Process\nYou will play introductory and an advanced scenarios of the Back Bay Battery simulation.\nThe advanced scenario will have adjusted settings to encourage deeper understanding of the principles at play.\nYou will have access to the simulation via your Harvard Business account (details provided on Blackboard).\nUse your experiences in both rounds to develop insights for your reflective essay.\nAssessment Marking Rubric is available on Blackboard\nAI Statement\nThis assignment requires critical reflection and original analysis. While AI or MT tools may assist with structuring or refining ideas, your essay must demonstrate independent critical thinking and synthesis of learning.\nAll AI or MT use must be referenced appropriately. Failure to disclose AI assistance may constitute academic misconduct.\nPlagiarism or over-reliance on AI-generated content will result in penalties. Your essay should reflect your own interpretation and understanding of the simulation and related concepts.\nFinal Reminders\nEnsure your essay is analytical, not just descriptive.\nUse high-quality academic sources in your discussion.\nSubmit on time via Blackboard.\nRead full task description\nHide full task description",
